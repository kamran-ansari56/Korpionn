Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kamran Ansari from Mumbai, with 8+ years of diverse experience spanning the Travel Industry and Data Analytics. My professional journey started in the Travel sector, where I spent nearly 5 years mastering operations and customer experience. The COVID-19 pandemic became a turning point, guiding me toward the dynamic field of Data Analytics â€” where data transforms into decisions.

My Journey ðŸš€
At Expertrons, I served as an Analytics Manager, leading a team of 12+ coaches and driving data-backed strategies to optimize operations. Unfortunately, the company ceased operations due to legal complications.
I then moved to Zell Education as a Lead Analyst, where I developed Excel and Power BI reports, managed a team of MIS professionals, and played a key role in the company's expansion to two new locations. However, the BYJUâ€™s crisis in the education sector led to my department being laid off.
I joined Summit Consultancy as a Lead Analyst, overseeing data management, inventory control, and labor management, creating end-to-end reports to support project managers.
Currently, I work as a Lead Consultant at Icon Technologies, where I leverage my skills in Data Analytics, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Machine Learning to deliver business insights and predictive models that drive growth and efficiency.
Machine Learning Expertise ðŸ¤–
My data journey has evolved beyond dashboards â€” I now build Machine Learning models to extract insights and make predictions. I've worked on:

Time-Series Forecasting to predict sales and inventory demands.
Classification Models to identify potential customer churn.
Regression Models for pricing optimization.
Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to gauge customer feedback.
What Drives Me ðŸ”¥
I'm more data-informed than data-driven â€” because I believe every dataset has a story waiting to be told. I specialize in making insights:
âœ… Relatable
âœ… Understandable
âœ… Actionable

What's Next?
I'm looking for new challenges where I can combine Data Analytics and Machine Learning to build impactful solutions that help businesses thrive.

Let's connect and explore how I can help your business unlock the power of data!
