Hi, I am Kamran Ansari! ðŸ”¥

With 8+ years of diverse experience spanning the Travel Industry and Data Analytics, I craft stories from raw data that drive informed business decisions.

My journey started in the bustling world of travel, where I spent 5 enriching years mastering operations and customer experiences. The pandemic reshaped my path, unlocking a newfound passion for Data Analytics â€” where insights meet action.

Currently working as a Lead Analyst at an MNC, here are my humble contributions:

ðŸ’¡ Identified key business KPIs that empowered clients to assess performance and drive better strategies.
ðŸ“Š Built automated dashboards with continuous data feeds, cutting down manual efforts and exposing missing data gaps critical for business performance.
ðŸš€ Optimized SQL queries and data pipelines, improving report performance and operational efficiency.
ðŸ“Œ Simplified complex datasets into actionable insights, helping stakeholders make data-informed decisions.

I believe in being data-informed rather than data-driven â€” because numbers should tell stories that inspire action, not just charts on a dashboard.
